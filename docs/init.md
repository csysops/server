### HTTP
- you want to order something, go to `mall`, look for right `store`, you order `food`, order `drink` => `mall:store/food` || `mall:store/drink`
- you want to order something, go to `ip`, look for right `port`, you order `/food`, order `/drink` => `ip:port/food` || `ip:port/drink`
- `ip` tell which machine, `port` tell which program on that machine serving you, single program serving multiple services
### Networking
- `socket` is abstraction, an illusion communicating through network same as operating on file, `send/receive` == `write/read`, include [`ip`, `port`] information, one `socket` map to one `port`, one port can have multiple `socket` point to
